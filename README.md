**Introduction**

Welcome to the Global COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker and Image Processing Tool! This project aims to provide users with a comprehensive toolset for tracking COVID-19 vaccination data globally and performing various image processing operations. Developed by Sulaiman Waliu as part of the Master of Biometrics and Intelligent Vision program at Universite Paris Est Creteil University, this tool offers a user-friendly interface powered by Python programming language and PyQt5.


**Global COVID-19 Tracker – Help and Information**

**Functionality:**

The data processing section involves data cleaning, processing, and analyzing the Covid-19 vaccination data using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. 
The dataset used from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations. The main tabs in this section include Graph, Chart, and Map.

**Visualization Tabs:**

**Graph tab:** Visualizes selected country data including daily vaccinations, total vaccinations, people vaccinated, daily people vaccinated, and people fully vaccinated. Users have the flexibility to plot single or multiple countries for effective comparison.

**Chart tab:** The Chart tab offers line plot and scatter plot options, enabling users to track Covid-19 vaccine trends using selected data. This section provides a dynamic way to observe and compare vaccination data.

**Map tab:** Explore the world map in the Map tab, illustrating total vaccinations, percentage of people vaccinated, and percentage of people fully vaccinated in each country. This visual representation offers a comprehensive view of global vaccination efforts.

 
 **Image Processing – Help and Information**
 
Welcome to the Image Processing component, where users can upload, save, and manipulate images. Developed with Python and utilizing the OpenCV library, this module provides a range of functionalities for image and video processing.

**Functionality:**

**Image Upload and Save:** Users can upload and save images for processing.

**Basic Operations**: Users can perform transformations, image enhancement, filtering, zooming in and out, and rotation.

**Advanced Operations**: Includes functionalities like Gamma correction, Gaussian filter, Log transform, Dilate and Erosion, and Canny edge detection.

**Web Cam Live Feed:** The Web Cam Live Feed section allows users to perform basic video processing tasks, including grayscale conversion, Canny edge detection, Otsu thresholding, and more. A comparison feature is available to visualize the impact of different video processing techniques.
Histogram Plotting: Users can visualize the histogram of uploaded images for better analysis.
Interface Interaction: Navigate seamlessly through the interface to access different functionalities. The user-friendly design ensures easy interaction with image and video processing features.
